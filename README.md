# Simulated-ECommerce-Portal

The Simulated E commerce Portal is developed to provide the customers their desired product by identifying the nearest retailer who has 
that product in stock. It also maintains that the warehouse supplies the products to the retail stores on demand and the supplier ships 
the requested products to the warehouse. The software can be used to maintain as large as a multinational retail corporation. It uses the 
Google Maps API to identify the locality  of  the  retail  stores  and  warehouses.  The  retail  store  managers,  warehouse 
administrators and the suppliers can log into the system and keep track of the products and stock. The data is maintained in large 
databases.

The  customer  will  not  have  any  login  id.  They  will  use  the  console  to  specify  the products details. The system does not 
incorporate the credit card processing services. It also does not allow the users of the system to view and edit their profiles. It does 
not provide any billing services
